# QHacks '24 Bayun Systems Challenge Winner :trophy: : murmr
## AI-Powered Audio Processing Suite (on mobile :iphone: :open_mouth:)

* Noise Isolation Processing
* NLP Audio Transcription
* OpenAI Image Generation
  
### ALL at your fingertips!

## The Stack 
**Front-end :** react-native  

**Back-end :** python, flask, sqlalchemy, sqlite  

**AI + Pipelining Tech :** OpenAI, google-speech-recognition, scipy, asteroid, RNNs, NLP

## What it does
We built a mobile app which allows users to record video and applies an AI-powered audio processing pipeline. 

**Primary use case:** Hard of hearing aid which:

1. Isolates + amplifies sound from a recorded video (pre-trained RNN model)
2. Transcribes text from isolated audio (google-speech-recognition)
3. Generates NLP context from transcription (NLP model)
4. Generates an associated image to topic being discussed (OpenAI API)

   
## How we built it  
* Frameworked UI on Figma  
* Started building UI using react-native  
* Researched models for implementation
* Implemented neural networks and APIs
* Testing, Testing, Testing
